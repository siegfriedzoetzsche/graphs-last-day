* Organisation 
- Date and time: 22.02.2016 (02/22/2016 for our friends of US date format), 17:30 military time (5.30 p.m.)
- Beer and pizza. We need volunteers to buy the beer! If wine is desired, somebody needs to bring it (keep it affordable)
- If not absolutely necessary, please don't show any live demos. Preferred form: pdf or something else portable (LINUX COMPATIBLE!!) If you have something non-compatible bring your own (VGA-COMPATIBLE!!) laptop


* Presentation
** General remarks
- Focus on what didn't work
- Make the final presentation about the chemical part (exploration of network). Only present catalan-related stuff when you found something new / exiting
- Don't tell what we already now, either from the lectures or from the groups presenting before you (prepare a presentation, don't expect to be able to present)
- summarize what you learnt, no lengthy presentation
** Contents
- Our group worked on ... reaction, this was finite/not, interesting molecules are ..., etc. 
- Some things only make sense in combination of groups (minimal infinte combination etc.). It is up to the groups to organize oneselves
- Which combination of chem. reactions grow linearly / slowly, which quickly?
- Synthesize, focus on the essentials. Don't talk about it too extensively. KISS-principle
- Keep the presentation to a few minutes per group, rather use the time for discussion!


* A piece of motivation
Peter has seen some interesting facets that make him hopeful we can make something of that. If it's interesting, there is the chance to be refered to in paper!

* Still ToDo
Please fill in the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gwP0ljPHGVtd0AXYImAXzFrFo-3pkWLySc1uI4FH0IY/edit?usp=sharing] [gdoc]] for feedback / fixes for the graph rewriting engine / mod.
Don't put in feedback for the graphical interface. That one was supposed to be reported only via the questionare!
